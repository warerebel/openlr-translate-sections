Translate sections from OpenLR linear references to a target mapping network model
===================================================================
# Introduction

OpenLR is a dynamic location reference standard to enable systems to exchange location information in a map-agnostic manner. [OpenLR association](http://http://www.openlr.org/)

When an overall OpenLR reference is broken down further into linear sections, this library assists in assigning those sections to the mapping model the OpenLR references are decoded to.
